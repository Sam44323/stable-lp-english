    description:
      "At Stable, we are committed to offering the simplest, quickest, safest, and most transparent tokenization model, which is pushing us toward issuing our own fully regulated, licensed, and transparent fiat-backed stablecoins so that we can offer the following benefits: stablecoins based on currencies other than the US dollar for global asset tokenization, fast and convenient tokenization, no third party systematic risks, transparent audits coupled with Proof of Reserve reports.

    title:
      "How is Stable maintaining the pegs and what makes our holding trustable for stablecoins and RWAâ€™s?",
    description:
      "Stablecoins are hard pegged to the value of 1 to backing currency when minting and redeeming, and the backing is directly reported through Chainlink Proof of Reserve reports. The securities and assets that we tokenize (RWAs) will adhere to the same standards as our stablecoin when it comes to audits and proof of reserve reporting. A ratio of one-to-one will once again back each RWA token. Price feeds for our stablecoins and RWA tokens are provided by Chainlink to ensure maximum accuracy and safety. If there will be an on-chain depeg event, the peg can be restored thanks to Arbitrageurs and friendly Market making funds buying on-chain and redeeming stablecoins for a value of 1 or RWA for off-chain market price, or vice versa.",

      " What are some of the major solutions which Stable is bringing to the market?",
    description: [
      "Stable's objective is to broaden the range of fiat-backed stablecoins by introducing stUSD, stEUR, stCNY, and more, enabling users to diversify their stablecoin holdings and facilitating the development of a fully functional forex market on the blockchain. Moreover, these stablecoins will offer instant usability by granting access to the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs), enhancing their value proposition.",
      "Through our RWA system, we aim to tokenize real-world assets and securities, creating a seamless and accessible platform for buying, selling, and gaining exposure to these valuable assets.",
      "As part of our tokenization service, users will receive RWA tokens, ERC tokens directly backed and linked to the specific asset they have bought with our stablecoins. These tokens will mirror the asset's price on the open market of assets that are backing them 1:1, thanks to Chainlink's Oracle integration. To further enhance the utility of our RWA tokens, we plan to collaborate with industry-leading lending, CDP, and DEX protocols, allowing them to be utilized as collateral or in a liquidity pool.",

      "What are the major regulations that Stable is complying with for smooth workings?",
    description: `Stable legal structure will consist of multiple limited liability companies (LLCs) operating across various regions, including the European Union, EMEA, and APAC. Each LLC will be subject to independent regulation by local authorities, ensuring complete compliance in the creation and operation of native currency stablecoins and our tokenization service within their respective jurisdictions. This approach enables us to provide optimized compliance solutions tailored to each operating region, enhancing regulatory adherence.

 In alignment with the MiCA regulations, we are committed to operating in full compliance and obtaining an E-Money EMI License and Investment firm license. This positions us as one of the pioneering issuers of Stablecoin and Real World Asset (RWA) tokens in the European Union, further solidifying our commitment to regulatory compliance and establishing ourselves as a trusted participant in the market.
