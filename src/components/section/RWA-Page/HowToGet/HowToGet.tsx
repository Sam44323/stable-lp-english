            To be able to mint, redeem or act as arbitrageur for Stable's Real

            successfully complete our KYC and AML checks. Once itâ€™s all done,
            you are free to unleash the maximum potential of RWAs.

          The actual process involves burning the stablecoins, buying the assets
          for backing, and minting the RWA token. With a focus on transparency
          and 1:1 asset backing, each RWA token is fully backed by an equivalent
          amount of assets that is representing. This means that 100 StTSLA
          tokens are backed by 100 TSLA shares in Stable's custody, which is
          reported through Chainlinks Proof of Reserve.
